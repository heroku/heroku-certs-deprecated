* Need to show certificate info when rolling back?

Finished
--------

* Show cert info action
* Cough up certificate info when adding, updating, rolling back
* Check if update works properly IRL (it did not)
* Add notes to certs:remove about monthly charges
* Trusted? column in list
* Deleting ssl:endpoint addon should not cascade, and should show error if there are endpoints left
* Cannot create more than one endpoint for an app
