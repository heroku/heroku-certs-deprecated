SSL Endpoint Heroku CLI Plugin
==============================

**NOTICE: Certs has been merged to the Heroku gem. This plugin is no longer required and is now deprecated.**

A plugin for the Heroku command line interface to perform operations against an app's SSL endpoints. SSL endpoints are Heroku's new unified SSL solution for the Heroku platform.

Installation
------------

Install this plugin:

    heroku plugins:install https://github.com/heroku/heroku-certs.git

Activate the `ssl:endpoint` addon:

    heroku addons:add ssl:endpoint

Usage
-----

Your app must be configured with a domain that will be protected by the SSL certificate you'll be adding:

    heroku domains:add example.org

Now you're ready to create an SSL endpoint right after you've acquired a certificate:

    heroku certs:add example.org.crt example.org.key

Check that your certificate was added successfully:

    heroku certs

Development
-----------

A simple Rake task is bundled to easily deploy the current state of the plugin to your Heroku gem's plugins directory (i.e. `~/.heroku/plugins`):

    rake deploy

Tests
-----

Run the test suite using:

    bundle install
    rake spec
